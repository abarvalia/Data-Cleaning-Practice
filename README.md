# Data_Cleaning_Practice_Pandas
Hi!

In this folder, I've practiced cleaning a dataset and performing simple analysis of it using the Python Pandas and Matplotlib packages.
To view the work I've done, please read through the two Jupyter notebooks I've shared in sequence (the first is called San Francisco Building Permits Analysis _ Part 1 and the second is called San Francisco Building Permits Analysis _ Part 2). I've provided comments on each step of the cleaning and analysis to elaborate on my thought process. In addition, I've provided the link to the dataset I downloaded from Kaggle.

I had a lot of fun doing this, and I'm always looking to learn more about data cleaning and analysis. Feedback is always welcome.

Thanks for taking the time to check this out!

Sincerely,
Aneri Barvalia
